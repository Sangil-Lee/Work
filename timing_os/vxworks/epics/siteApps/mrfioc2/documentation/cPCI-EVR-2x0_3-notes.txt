= Interrupts =

The Event link RX error interrupt occurs whenever any momentary glitch occurs.
If the link goes completely down (unplugged) this interrupt will occur continously.
Therefore, if it does occur it must be disabled.  Its status bit will continue
to indicate if the interrupt was asserted.  It must be polled periodically by attempting
to clear it (write 1 and then read 0).  If it is cleared, then then interrupt can be
re-enabled.

This is not an entirely satisfactory approach since polling depends on the interrupt
reoccuring between a write and subsequent read of the interrupt status register.
More importantly there is not distinction between momentary error (CRC, ?) and carrier
(laser) loss.

= Registers =

== Status Register (Page 13-14) ==

Bit 16 is named LEGVIO or "Legacy VIO".  This is actually the link RX violation flag.

== Interrupt Flag/Enable Registers (Page 14-15) ==

The 'Event interrupt' would be better named 'Event FIFO not empty interrupt'.

== Event Counter Clock Prescaler Register (Page 16-17) ==

This field is an integer divider going from the event link rate to the timestamp rate.

Setting to 0 sets the TS source to either DBus bit 4 or TS Event code (see Control Register).

A setting of >0 sets the TS source to the divided event link.  Realistically this will
be 1 unless the event link rate is high enough to overflow the 32 bit TS counter.

== Microsecond Divider Register ==
