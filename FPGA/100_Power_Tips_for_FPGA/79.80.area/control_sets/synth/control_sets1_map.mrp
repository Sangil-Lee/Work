Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=SLICE_X28Y2) which requires the combination of the symbols
   listed below to be packed into a single SLICEL component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: A flop using synchronous
   set/reset cannot be combined with one that uses asynchronous set/reset.

   The symbols involved are:
   	FLOP symbol "data_out1" (Output Signal = data_out1_OBUF)
   	FLOP symbol "data_out2" (Output Signal = data_out2_OBUF)

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc6slx45' is a WebPack part.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
