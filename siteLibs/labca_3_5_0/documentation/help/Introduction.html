Introduction</A>
</H1>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> package provides an interface to the
EPICS channel access client library which can be
integrated with the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scilab</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">matlab</SPAN> applications.
Both, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scilab</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">matlab</SPAN> feature an API for interfacing
to user binaries written in a programming language such
as C or Fortran. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> properly wraps the essential
channel access routines and makes them accessible
from the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scilab</SPAN><A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot856"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>command line.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> actually uses an extra layer, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ezca</SPAN> library
which transparently manages and caches channel access 
connections. A modified version of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ezca</SPAN> comes with
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN>, adding thread-safety and hence EPICS 3.14 fitness.

<P>
As of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> version 3 further improvements to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ezca</SPAN>
have been made that exploit features of the multi-threaded
CA library (EPICS 3.14 only) in order to speed up response time.
Earlier versions always handed control to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ezca</SPAN> in multiples of the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">timeout</SPAN>, i.e., even if data from a channel
were available quicker the library would wait until the
next timeout quantum expired. Since version 3 a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN>
call returns immediately after the underlying request
completes.

<P>
A very convenient feature of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> is the ability
to execute <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ezca</SPAN> calls on groups of PVs, simply by
passing the respective <SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> routine a column vector
of PV names.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> has been tested with EPICS 3.13<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="#foot857"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A>,
3.14, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scilab</SPAN>-2.7 .. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">scilab</SPAN>-5.3,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">matlab</SPAN>-6.5, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">matlab</SPAN>-7 (R2010a) on <SPAN  CLASS="textit">linux</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">solaris</SPAN> and
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">win32/64</SPAN>. Note that while some of these combinations have been
tested and been known working in the past, only the latest
versions of the respective components have been tested
and verified to build and run successfully with the
current version of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">labCA</SPAN> under <SPAN  CLASS="textit">linux</SPAN>.
Modifications to the <TT>Makefile</TT>s might be necessary to
build older versions.
