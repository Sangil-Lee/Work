A bit confusing with all the different versions.

Linux Host, R3.14.4 base:
 ../../bin/linux-x86/example st.cmd.host

You might need to set this:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib/linux-x86:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;

st.cmd.3_14 is meant for a vxWorks IOC under R3.14

st.cmd is meant for vxWorks IOCs under 3.13.7
