This driver was written for ControlLogix,
but also seems to work with CompactLogix,
as reported by Mike Forster <mike4ster@gmail.com>:

We saw that when a record scan list became long (too many records with the same scan rate),
all the elements in that scan list would stop responding.
Eventually we traced this down to the EIP_buffer_limit which was the default 500.
This limit at 500 allows data to be sent that is 554 bytes long.  After some trial and
error we found that the PLC responded correctly if the data sent was 548 bytes long or less.
When we set EIP_buffer_limit to 494 our problems went away.
