S7nodave for EPICS
   Device support and driver for EPICS communication with S7 PLCs 
================================================================================

ABOUT
-----

S7nodave is a device support and driver for using S7 PLCs with an EPICS IOC,
which is based on Snap7 (http://snap7.sourceforge.net/).

Using s7nodave, you can read variables from or write data to the PLC using the 
ISO on TCP protocol. You only have to specify the memory address and data-type
for each item you want to read or write.


A WORD OF CAUTION
-----------------

When using this software to connect to a PLC, disconnect ALL external equipment
from the PLC before trying to establish a connection.

This software can overwrite variables in the PLC memory or even parts of the
program running in the PLC. Therefore outputs of the PLC might show 
unpredictable behavior.

There are a lot of different PLC types and depending on the type of the PLC, its
configuration, the type of the host machine used for the EPICS IOC, the host 
machine's configuration and the EPICS IOC's configuration, this software might 
have very different, potentially unwanted results.

It is always the responsibility of the user using this software to ensure, that
its use is safe and complies with local regulation BEFORE connecting any 
equipment to the PLC. Violations of this rules might result in equipment being
damaged or even PERSONS BEING INJURED by misbehaving equipment.


COMPILING
---------

You need to add the configure/RELEASE.local file and set the EPICS_BASE and ASYN
variables to the locations of your EPICS Base and Asyn installation directories.

You might also have to add configure/CONFIG_SITE.local and append the
appropriate compiler options (e.g. "-std=c++11") for enabling C++ 11 support to
the USR_CXXFLAGS variable.

As Snap7 is bundled with s7nodave for EPICS, there is no need to compile Snap7
separately. It will be compiled and placed in the lib directory automatically
when running make.


USING THE DEVICE SUPPORT / DRIVER
---------------------------------

In order to use the device support and driver in an IOC, you have to add the
line

S7NODAVE=/path/to/s7nodave

to the configure/RELEASE file of your IOC application. Assuming your IOC 
application name is "xxx", you also have to add the two lines

xxx_DBD += s7nodave.dbd
xxx_LIBS += s7nodave

to the file xxxApp/src/Makefile.

You can the use DTYP "s7nodave" for most record types. The device addresses
have the form "@myPLC IB0" where "myPLC" is the name of a port created using

s7nodaveConfigureIsoTcpPort("myPLC", "s7plc.local.marsching.com", 0, 0, 0)

in iocBoot/iocxxx/st.cmd and "IB0" is a memory address in the usual S7 notation.

Please see the extended documentation in the docs directory for more detailed
information about how to use s7nodave for EPICS.
