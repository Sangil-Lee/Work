To use: Add this directory to the application CONFIGURE/RELEASE file and the
following lines to the application Makefile:
    xxx_DBD += devTDS3000.dbd   (or devTDS5000.dbd)
    xxx_LIBS += devTDS3000


Installation
============
1) Edit configure/RELEASE and set EPICS_BASE, ASYN and SNCSSEQ appropriately.
2) cd to this directory and run make.


Testing
=======
1) cd to iocBoot/iocscope.
2) Edit the st.cmd script and uncomment/edit the lines to match your hardware.
   Set the TDS_FAMILY and TDS_ETHER environment variables for your hardware.
3) Run the application (../../bin/<arch>/scope st.cmd).
4) cd to medm.
5) Set the EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES environment variable:
   export EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES=80000
6) Run medm with arguments to match your st.cmd script:
   medm -x -macro "scope=<myprefix>" tds3000_c.adl
