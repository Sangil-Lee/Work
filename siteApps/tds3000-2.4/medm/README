- The top-level display is tds3000_c.adl which takes a single macro argument:
    medm -x -macro "scope=scopeTest:" tds3000_c.adl 

- EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES environment variable must be set to 80000 or higher.

- These MEDM displays are best used with MEDM version 3.0.3 or higher since
  they use a PV to set the number of points on the Cartesian plots.

- The trace10K script is for SDDS. An option is on the lower right hand
  corner of the main tds3000 MEDM display to use this function. SDDS is
  required for this function to work. SDDS can be download for the
  Advanced Photon Source, www.aps.anl.gov.
