# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.
#
# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files
# external to this application. Thus you should run
# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in the RELEASE file is rebuilt.

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# If you don't want to install into $(TOP) then
# define INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here
#INSTALL_LOCATION_APP=<fullpathname>

## EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
SNCSEQ=${EPICS_PATH}/epicsLibs/synApps_5_8/support/seq-2-2-1
ASYN=${EPICS_SYNAPPS}/asyn-4-26

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE=${HOME}/epics/R3.14.12.5/base

#Capfast users may need the following definitions
#CAPFAST_TEMPLATES=
#SCH2EDIF_PATH=
