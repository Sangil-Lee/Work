    * 2. The device writes to those 7 elements, filling up the FIFO.
    * 3. Attempt to acquire 7 elements, get back 3 because we can only give a
    *    pointer to 3 elements.
    *
    * **Behavior with Mirrored Elements**:
    *
    * If instead we had mirrored 4 elements, it would act like this.
    *
    *        0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9{0-1-2-3}
    *        ^                   ^mirrored elements

    *                      Current FIFO pointer here.
    *
    * 2. The device writes to those 7 elements, filling up the FIFO.
