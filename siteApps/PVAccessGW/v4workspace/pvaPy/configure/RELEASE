# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)


# It is not necessary to edit this file if you autoconfigure the
# pvaPy module (make configure ...).

# For manual configuration, copy the variables below to a new
# file RELEASE.local, uncomment them and point them to the
# appropriate pre-built module directories. You may uncomment
# and edit them here instead, but must then create an empty
# RELEASE.local file for the build to work. Also see the
# CONFIG_SITE file for manual Boost and Python configuration.

# EPICS4_DIR is used here for convenience only
#EPICS4_DIR = /path/to/epics4/modules
#PVACLIENT = $(EPICS4_DIR)/pvaClientCPP
#PVACCESS = $(EPICS4_DIR)/pvAccessCPP
#NORMATIVE = $(EPICS4_DIR)/normativeTypesCPP
#PVDATA = $(EPICS4_DIR)/pvDataCPP
# NB: Do NOT link to pvCommonCPP, its copy of Boost may be
#     incompatible with the Boost Python one.

# Base comes last:
#EPICS_BASE = /path/to/epics/base
