Internal Source Code Naming Conventions
---------------------------------------
o API class X will almost always have associated internal (usually 
	private base) class named XI
o for class X there will 
	o sometimes be X.h - the class declaration (and simple inlines)
	o sometimes be XIL.h - complex inline functions (that will not
		compile unless the compiler has seen
		the declarations of other classes)
	o be X.cc - all other source code for the class
