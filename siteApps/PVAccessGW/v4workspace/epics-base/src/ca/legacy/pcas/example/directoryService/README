This directory contains an example ca directory (name resolution) server. 

The directory server reads in a file with records as follows:
<PV name> <host name or dotted ip address> [<optional IP port number>]

The server responds to search requests with the server address of
the PV (not the address of this directory server).

This server can be used to cause EPICS to locate any PV listed in
the file anywhere on the internet. You must of course set EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST 
for the client so that it points at a running instance of this directory 
(name resolution) server.
