This directory contains the generic (os and io independent) source for 
the EPICS ca server library

The sub-diretory "mt" contains multi-threaded specific code and the
sub-directory "st" contains single-threaded specific code.

Design Notes:
1) When I was preparing a thread-safe version of the server lib I assumed
that all locking required to protect gdd::reference() and gdd::unreference()
will be provided by the gdd library.

2) The source file "templInst.cc" attempts to provide explicit instantiation 
of the template member functions required following the ANSI resolution 
r.14.9 in appendix A of Stroustrup's book. The problem is that Sun's
compiler does not recognize this syntax so we must "ifdef" the code until
this matter is resolved.

Here are some of the inheritance trees used by the server lib:
