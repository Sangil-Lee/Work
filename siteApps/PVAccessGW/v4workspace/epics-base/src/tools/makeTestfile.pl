# The makeTestfile.pl script generates a file $target.t which is needed
# because some versions of the Perl test harness can only run test scripts
# that are actually written in Perl.  The script we generate runs the
# real test program which must be in the same directory as the .t file.
# If the script is given an argument -tap it sets HARNESS_ACTIVE in the
# environment to make the epicsUnitTest code generate strict TAP output.

# Usage: makeTestfile.pl <target-arch> <host-arch> target.t executable
#     target-arch and host-arch are EPICS build target names (eg. linux-x86)
#     target.t is the name of the Perl script to generate
#     executable is the name of the file the script runs
