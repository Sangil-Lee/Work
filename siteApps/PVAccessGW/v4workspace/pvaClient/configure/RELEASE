# easyPVACPP RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE this file or any file it includes you must
# subsequently do a "gnumake rebuild" in the application's
# top level directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should also do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# EPICS V4 Developers: Do not edit the locations in this file!
#
# A RELEASE.local must exist that has the following definitions
#     EPICS_BASE=/home/install/epics/base
#     EPICS4_DIR=/home/epicsv4
#     PVCOMMON=${EPICS4_DIR}/pvCommonCPP
#     PVDATA=${EPICS4_DIR}/pvDataCPP
#     NORMATIVETYPES=${EPICSV4}/normativeTypesCPP
#     PVACCESS=${EPICS4_DIR}/pvAccessCPP
#Either create a RELEASE.local one level above the TOP for this module
#OR copy ExampleRELEASE.local to RELEASE.local and edit it.

-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local
