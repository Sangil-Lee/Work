    <h1>FPGA Firmware/Software Development</h1>
    The acquisition node and mitigation node firmware and software is
    distributed as a CentOS VirtualBox guest.&nbsp; The guest virtual
    machine has a super user account and a single user account with
    account name ‘fastprot’.&nbsp; The source code is kept in Mercurial
    repositories but, to keep the virtual machine environment as simple
    as possible, mercuial is not installed on the guest virtual
    machine.&nbsp; Instead the ‘fastprot’ home directory is mounted from
    the host machine using sshfs and mercurial is run on the host
    machine.<br>
    <br>
    The Vivado projects for the acquisition and mitigation nodes are at:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>~fastprot/src/FastProtectAcq/FastProtectAcq.xpr</li>
      <li>~fastprot/src/FastProtect/FastProtect.xpr</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and the corresponding XSDK workspaces are within the Vivado
      projects at:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>~fastprot/src/FastProtectAcq/FastProtectAcq.sdk</li>
      <li>~fastprot/src/FastProtect/FastProtect.sdk</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Setting up the virtual machine</h2>
    <h2> </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Download VirtualBox from <a
          href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>
        and install it.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Uncompress and unpack the FastProtection.tar.bz2 virtual
        box tarball.</li>
      <li>Start VirtualBox. The first time this is done it may ask if
        the 'VirtualBox Extension Pack' is to be installed.&nbsp; If so,
        agree to this and let VirtualBox install the extensions.&nbsp;
        If not, explicitly <a
href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.8/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.8-111374.vbox-extpack">download</a>
        the extensions and double-click to installm.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Once VirtualBox is running with extensions installed, click
        the Machine→Add menu items and browse to and select the
        FastProtection.vbox file unpacked in the step above.&nbsp; A
        'FastProtection' virtual machine should appear in the list at
        the left side of the VirtualBox Manager window.&nbsp; The
        virtual machine development environment is now ready to run.</li>
      <li>To shut down the guest machine, click on the small triangle in
        the upper right corner of the virtual machine main window then
        click on the 'power button' that appears in the pop-up window.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Starting the development tools<br>
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In the VirtualBox Manager window select the 'FastProtection'
        virtual machine then click the green 'Start' arrow.&nbsp; The
        result should be a CentOS Linux guest operating system in a
        window on your host machine.</li>
      <li>From a terminal window on the host machine use ssh to log in
        to the guest system:<br>
        <tt>ssh -Y </tt><tt>fastprot@192.168.56.104</tt><br>
        The final component of the guest machine network address may
        vary.&nbsp; The easiest way to determine the value is to log in
        to the guest machine from its main window and then use
        'ifconfig' to determine the network configuration.</li>
      <li>Once successfully logged in to the guest machine start <tt>vivado</tt>
        or <tt>xsdk</tt>.</li>
      <li>Another useful command from the host machine is to use sshfs
        to mount the guest machine's fastprot user home directory so
        that mercurial or tftp can be run on the host machine and files
        copied easily between the guest and host machines:<br>
        <tt>mkdir -p ~/fastprotect</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>sshfs </tt><tt>fastprot@192.168.56.104:. ~/fastprotect<br>
        </tt></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Building firmware and software<br>
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start vivado</li>
      <li>Select the project (FastProtect or FastProtectAcq)</li>
      <li>In the leftmost pane under 'Program and Debug' click 'Generate
        Bitstream'.&nbsp; The firmware build date will be updated
        automatically.<br>
      </li>
      <li>When the build completes click the 'File→Export→Export
        Hardware...' menu item.&nbsp; In the window that pops up ensure
        the the 'Include bitstream' box is checked and the pulldown menu
        is set to '&lt;Local to Project&gt;' then click 'OK'.</li>
      <li>The SDK tool can then be launched with the 'File→Launch SDK'
        menu item.&nbsp; The SDK workspace is local to the project.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Before building the SDK project run the
        'setSoftwareBuildDate.sh' script in the application source
        directory.</li>
      <li>Once the SDK project has been built select the
        FastProtect_FSBL (or FastProtectAcq_FSBL as appropriate) in the
        left pane then right click on that name and click on 'Create
        Boot Image' in the menu that pops up, then in the window that
        appears, click 'Create Image'.&nbsp; The result will be a
        'BOOT.bin' file in the 'bootimage' directory below the
        FastProtect_FSBL (or FastProtectAcq_FSBL) directory.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Transferring boot image to ZC706 flash memory</h2>
    <p>The Xilinx flash memory programming tool fails when an SFP FMC
      card is connected to the ZC706.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For the mitigation node this is not a problem since the ZC706 has
      a network connection and runs a TFTP server that allows the boot
      image to be uploaded to the board and written to the flash
      memory.&nbsp; For example, assuming that the guest machine
      fastprot home directory has been mounted on the host machine as
      described above:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><code>$ <b>cd
            ~fastprotect/src/FastProtect/FastProtect.sdk/FastProtect_FSBL/bootimage</b><br>
          $ <b>tftp 192.168.1.10</b></code><br>
        <code>tftp&gt; <b>bin</b></code><br>
        <code>tftp&gt; <b>put BOOT.bin</b></code><br>
        <code>Sent 13622292 bytes in 34.7 seconds</code><br>
        <code>tftp&gt; <br>
        </code></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><code></code>There is no such workaround for the acquisition
      nodes.&nbsp; The SFP FMC card must be removed before using the
      xsdk 'Program Flash' tool.</p>
