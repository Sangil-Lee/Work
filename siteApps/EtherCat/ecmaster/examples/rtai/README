This is a minimal example module for the use of the EtherCAT master realtime
interface with an RTAI thread.

The module expects an RTAI installation. Configure the master sources
specifying --with-rtai-dir to have the right include paths.

Most probably you'll have different EtherCAT slaves present. Try adjusting the
section "process data" in rtai_sample.c to your bus configuration.

There are some features that can be disabled by commenting out the respective
defines at the head of rtai_sample.c.

---

To build the example module, call:

make modules

To run it, load the appropriate RTAI modules and call:

insmod ec_rtai_sample.ko

...and watch the system logs for the outputs.
